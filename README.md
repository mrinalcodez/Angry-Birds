# Angry Birds Clone in libGDX (Java)

This is a simple Angry Birds clone game developed using libGDX, a popular framework for building cross-platform games. The game is designed to run on Windows, but libGDX allows you to extend it to other platforms as well. This project demonstrates basic game mechanics, including projectile physics, level design, and collision detection.

## Features

- **Physics Engine**: Utilizes libGDX's Box2D physics for realistic projectile motion and object interactions.
- **Levels**: Multiple levels with different obstacles and targets.
- **Game Assets**: Custom graphics, sounds, and animations to resemble a bird-flinging experience.
- **Windows Compatibility**: Designed to run on Windows, but can be extended to other platforms using libGDX.

## Prerequisites

Before running the game, ensure you have the following installed:

1. **Java Development Kit (JDK)** - Version 8 or higher. Download from [Oracle JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk8-downloads.html).
2. **Gradle** - The build tool used for managing dependencies and building the game. Download from [Gradle Official Website](https://gradle.org/install/).
3. **libGDX** - Game development framework. You can download it from the [libGDX website](https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/).
4. **IDE (Integrated Development Environment)** - IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or any Java IDE that supports Gradle.
